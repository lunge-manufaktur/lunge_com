          h2 Flexible suspension
          p New material, optimized surface geometry and improved damping characteristics - the midsole of the Neo Run is a minor revolution and the foundation of a shoe that, thanks to careful development, reaches new heights in terms in terms of comfort and efficient suspension. 

          p Whether it's training or competition - the Neo Run is an excellent choice for any runner that needs little pronation support and stability and enjoys comfortable suspension. Due to its remarkable flexibility and agility this shoe shines on fast runs as well as off the track in everyday life.

          h2 Breeze through your run
          p For the Neo Run we went back to the drawing board and developed the midsole from scratch. The result is a foundation that allows for a more comfortable and easier run. A key factor to this advantage is our new midsole material, which features exceptional bounce characteristics and efficiently preserves energy during impact, thereby rendering every step of your run slightly more effortless.

          p As expected from Lunge shoes, the geometry of the sole was developed, tested and improved in countless iterations and careful optimizations in order to design a cushion your feet will lastingly benefit from.

          p As a premium running shoe functionality, comfort and fit are key features to consider and the Neo Run, thanks to very few, large upper components, offers an exceptional fit that feels like a seamless second skin on your feet while providing secure footing and welcome flexibility.
          p The combiantion of finest inner lining and breathable mesh enables optimal air supply as well as moisture transport.
